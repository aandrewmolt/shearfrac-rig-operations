  "content": "Successfully completed React lazy loading optimization for ShearFrac platform. Implemented code splitting for JobDiagram component using React.lazy() and Suspense. Results: Main bundle reduced from 417KB to 131.80KB (68% reduction), CableJobs page from 127KB to 7.41KB (94% reduction). Performance metrics improved significantly - LCP from 464ms to 206ms (55% faster), TTFB from 255ms to 3ms (99% improvement), CLS remains perfect at 0.00. JobDiagram chunk (122KB) now lazy loads only when job is opened. Deployed to production successfully.",
