## Project Goal

ShearFrac Operations Platform - A comprehensive well rig equipment and job management system for fracking operations. Provides real-time equipment tracking, job diagram visualization, inventory management, and deployment tracking for oilfield operations.

**Production URL:** https://shearfrac-rig-operations.vercel.app

## Key Features

### Equipment Management
- Individual & bulk equipment inventory tracking
- Equipment type management (Y-Adapters, Wellside Gauges, Frack Hose, Swivels, Hammer Unions)
- Red-tagged equipment tracking and maintenance alerts
- Equipment deployment & return workflows
- Location-based equipment tracking
- Equipment usage statistics & history

### Job Management
- Interactive job diagram canvas with React Flow
- Real-time equipment allocation to jobs
- Cable/connection visualization
- Job contacts & crew management
- Job photo uploads & gallery
- Well configuration panels
- Equipment deployment summaries

### Technical Features
- Hybrid database: Turso (production) / Mock (development)
- Offline-first with service worker support
- Real-time sync via Supabase realtime (when configured)
- Knowledge graph integration for decision tracking
- React Query for data fetching & caching
- TypeScript with strict type checking

## Overall Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI:** shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI
- **State:** React Query + Context API
- **Database:** Turso (LibSQL) with mock fallback
- **Realtime:** Supabase realtime channels
- **Routing:** React Router v6
- **Diagram:** React Flow for job visualization
- **Deployment:** Vercel (auto-deploy from GitHub)

### Code Architecture
- Manager pattern for equipment operations (96 hooks â†’ 12 managers, 87% reduction)
- Unified sync system replacing 4 competing sync hooks
- Transaction-based bulk operations for data consistency
- Lazy module initialization to prevent race conditions
- Equipment CRUD, Search, Usage, Validation managers
- Compatibility wrappers for zero-downtime migrations

### Database Schema
- `equipment_types` - Equipment catalog
- `equipment_items` - Individual equipment inventory
- `bulk_equipment_deployments` - Bulk deployment tracking
- `jobs` - Job records
- `locations` - Equipment locations
- `contacts` - Company contacts
- `job_photos` - Job documentation
- `cable_types` - Connection types for diagrams

### Key Patterns
- Error boundaries for fault tolerance
- Safe wrappers for data providers
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Status validation for equipment mutations
- Module-level lazy initialization (no global state at module load)

## Recent Major Fixes (2025-10)
- Fixed empty equipment types in production (seed now runs for mock DB)
- Fixed duplicate JSX loading attributes causing build errors
- Fixed Types tab, Usage tab, Contacts page crashes
- Deployed comprehensive testing via complete-test MCP (score: 53/100)
- Initialized Memory Bank for better project documentation
